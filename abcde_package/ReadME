My copy of Nicks ABCDE method adapted for W Asymmetry measurement. 

I used this to run on the VBTF ntuples to act as a cross check for the ICF
ntuple measurement.

This package is designed to determine the W->enu signal from data.
The User should be able to produce all the histograms required from the MonteCarlo
and Data Ntuples provided by the ElectroWeakAnalysis/WENu package.

There are only 2 main steps *REQUIRED* to determine the Signal (and cross-section) 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

1) 	WenuAnalyser.py		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Dependant on classes.py

This will take specific Ntuples of the kind produces by EWK group
placed in ntuples 

and produce root files with 2D histograms.
These histograms are used in the ABCDE method.

WenuAnalyser must have the following command line arguments provided:

	[1] - Filename, ie the Ntuple containing the tree VBTFPreseleTree
	[2] - The number of Bins in X variable (eg for MET, this will be doubled for the MT plots)
	[3] - The number of Bins in Y variable (eg for TrckRelIso)
	[4] - The selection choices, eg 80 for WP80, 90 for WP90, 
	      80TrckRelIso for WP80 with modified TrckRelIso
	
The Selection choices are defined in ABCDEClasses.py
and included in a dictionary. If a new selection is added, it must also be added to the dictionary

Currently, the variable combinations produced are:

	X = PfMET, TcMET, CaloMET, MT, 
	Y = TrckRelIso, EcalRelIso, SigmaiEiE, dEta, dPhi

The root file produced by WenuAnalyser will contain one folder for each selection choice.
Each folder contains the ABCDE 2D histograms for Barrel/Endcap events (wenuanaEB/EE)
and also separated into electron and positron events.

In addidtion, tagandprobe distributions are created for the variables in Y

The maximum Y variable for the 2D hists and tag and probe is defined by the appropriate cut in he Selection choice
(This corresponds to the E box definition)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
2a)     ABCDEOptimize.py ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Run as:

	python ABCDEOptimize.py Selection EB/EE
This produces 2D histograms for the Bias and sensitivity to eP, currently uses only MonteCarlo.
These will be saved in results folder.

Selection is the choice of selection for the signal, EB - Barrel Only, EE - EndCap Only
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
 
2b)	ABCDESignal.py  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Dependant on ABCDEClasses.py
	     
Run as:
	python ABCDEOptimize.py Selection
	
This Step is where the ABCDEMethod is applied.
This procedure is configurable from ABCDEMonteCarloParams.py (Filenames, lumis, UserOptions, cut ranges)
This contains the choice of X and Y variable too.

The 2D histos are taken and used to make a MonteCarlo study of the ABCDE at the Y variable Boundaries chosen
(MakePlots option = True will produce Signal variations and MET distributions for each of these boundary choices)

In addition, Data is read in and the procedure applied with following options:
	
		1) UseDataDetectorParams = False
		
			Data will be sclaed to the ScaleTo parameter and all input 
			parameters are taken directly from the MonteCarlo
			
			However, If CorrectTheMCQCD, CorrectTheMCSignal or Use2DAntiSelection 
			are true, then these distributions will be used for the input parameters/
			determination of the bias instead of Raw MC.
			
			Note QCDAnalyser can produce the 2D histograms and is recommended.
		
		2) UseDataDetectorParams = True
			
			In this case, the efficiency and Acceptance are taken from 
			ABCDEMonteCarloParams.
			The parameters eA,eD and eP are taken from the MC 
			(or as above if extra templates are provided)
			
		3) UseErsatz = True
			2D histograms in Ersatz Template are used (can use 1D 
			by setting correct MC Signal = True and using
			this as the template.	
			All 3 parameters are taken from the Ersatz Templates 
			(provided separately)
			
			If 2D hists are unavailable from Ersatz, Can still use
			1D template by setting Correct MC Signal = True and 
			using this as correction template.
			
			3a) UseTagAndProbe = True
				Tag and probe from the data is used for eP
				rather than from Ersatz
				
Choices for EB/EE only and +/- only are available in ABCDEMonteCarloParams.py
Also choices to rescale MC to match Data Normalisation and Iterate the ABCDE for
electroweak backgrounds are defined here.

One Should use and empty string for the systematics file if no such templates are available.
This are not produced with the WenuAnalyser and must be taken from elsewhere or left 
blank.

The file ....Numbers.txt produce all of the parameters used in ABCDE and the Results + Errors
This and any plots made will be put into [Selection]Plots/
The user will be asked to make such a directory if it doesnt already exist.

Effort has been made to warn the user of all issues which may arise when running the code with 
missing files/histograms being detected however something is bound to have been overlooked.
