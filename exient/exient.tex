\Que{Using the “dim” command (or alternatively, “nrow” and “ncol”), write down the number of rows and columns in the data set.}
\Ans{\\
Rows: 4663 \\
Columns: 16}

\Que{What dates does the data set span? (Note: the data is in chronological order.)}
\Ans{"Aug 12, 2013 05:46 AM" to "Sep 09, 2013 05:04 AM"}

\Que{As shown on the first line of the data, the player with UserID 908844CB-6B9C-4499-B9F2-87CCB43042CD is using an Apple iPad Mini. What device is the player with UserID AAF9C549-6970-4536-9B67-03D2775F1A01 using? }
\Ans{"Apple iPhone 4s"}

\Que{How many times was level ‘00-00-Fruit-00’ played? (The answer is a two-digit number ending in ‘5’.) What proportion of these races had the outcome ‘beatLevel’?}
\Ans{\\
Played: 175\\
Beaten: 75 or 43\% }

\Que{What command(s) could you use to check that the lowest and highest times to finish a race are approximately are 1.02 and 5970 seconds?}
\Ans{\\
\tt max(exient\$RaceTime)\\
min(exient\$RaceTime)
}


\Que{The ‘TotalRaces’ column is in the range of 1 to 506. Some integers within this range do not appear in the dataset (e.g. 450, 470, 501). In fact, there are 26 such integers between 1 and 506. What is the sum of these 26 integers?}
\Ans{12170}

\Que{Write code to identify the set of races that the player with UID AAF9C549-6970-4536-9B67-03D2775F1A01 played in ‘Challenge’ mode (28 entries), and calculate the mean time they took to complete a race within this subset of data.}
\Ans{33.71643}

\Que{Generate a histogram of the time taken to complete a race, and comment on the plot. Determine the value T such that 95\% of race times are less than T.}
\Ans{ Figure \ref{fig:racetime}. There are several outliers, the longest time taken is 5969 seconds. Rows with a race time over 150 seconds have been omitted from plot. $T = 55.84911$.}

\Que{The histogram has been generated from the dataset and provides information on an important metric in mobile games. Its axes have been hidden. What does the plot represent? Write R code to reproduce the plot.}
\Ans{The plot represents, for each logged race, the time since install.\\
\tt hist(exient\$TimeSinceInstall,breaks=1000,\\
\hspace{1cm} xlim = c(0,300000), xlab="Time since install (s)")
}

\Que{For which version of the game were most races logged (approximately 69\% of the entries in the full data set)?}
\Ans{183806 with 3220 races logged}

\Que{In the version identified in the question above, how many entries were made by players who had spent more than 10 hours playing the game? (The answer is a 3-digit number ending in ‘8’).}
\Ans{958}

\Que{How many players were there in this subset of the data? Which two players might we wish to discard, and why? Can you investigate further and suggest why each of these oddities has arisen?}
\Ans{8 players. There is something peculiar with user\\
{\tt 7E964A54-996B-4F25-82AA-0B6D20438C02} and user \\
{\tt 46FC3345-5D33-4FD6-9444-EFECE98AC32C}.\\
Both users use different versions with the TimeInGame column which appears to reset. Presumably they reinstalled the game and we have data from both installations.}

\Que{Identify the strongest and weakest players based on the proportion of races in which they had an outcome of ‘beatLevel’. How confident are you in this assessment? Explain your answer briefly.}
\Ans{Disregarding the two previous users, the `strongest' player is 
{\tt 3C0CE2B2-72D4-4B43-98C7-B04747E95F32}
with 23 'beatLevel' out of 25 attempts, a ratio of 92\%. 

The `weakest' player is {\tt C327894B-3A7A-4469-AF77-FB60921C56A2} 
with only 79 `beatLevel' from 168 attempts, or 47\%. This is not a very strong assessment as the sample size for some of the users is small. It also does not take into account the relative difficulty of different levels/challenges.}
